<h1 align="center">Hi there 👋, I'm Xana Rahmani</h1>
<h3 align="center">Co-Founder & Blockchain Engineer building the future of decentralized finance.</h3>

---

I build secure, full-stack decentralized systems from protocol to production. My career journey has taken me from engineering the core multi-chain wallet infrastructure for centralized exchanges to co-founding and architecting a complete DeFi ecosystem.

*   🚀 Architecting foundational primitives, including **MakerDAO-style stablecoins**, **Aave-based lending markets**, and secure **cross-chain bridges**.
*   ⚙️ Engineering robust, multi-chain wallet systems for centralized exchanges, enabling support for diverse architectures like **UTXO (Bitcoin)**, **EVM**, **Solana**, and **memo-based chains (XRP/EOS)**.
*   🔗 Engineering secure cross-chain systems with **LayerZero**.
*   ⚡  Building critical off-chain systems in **Go**, including custom event indexers, auction keepers, and cross-chain relayers.
*   🤖 Exploring the intersection of AI and Blockchain with **RAG/LangChain**.
*   🔐 Advancing user experience with **Account Abstraction (ERC-4337)**.
